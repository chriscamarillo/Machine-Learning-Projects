Imbalanced. 
Implement the perceptron-learning algorithm (PLA). Choose three domains from the UCI repository and evaluate the PLAâ€™s behavior on each of them. Report the results along the following criteria: (1) error rate on an independent testing set, and (2) computational costs expressed as the number of example presentations needed to achieve 100% accuracy. Discuss the different results in each domain. Consider also the case where 100% accuracy is impossible because the classes are not linearly separable.
