# ECE548 Project 2

### Project Description
Imbalanced datasets. Implement the perceptron-learning algorithm (PLA). 
Choose three domains from the UCI repository and evaluate the PLAâ€™s behavior on each of them. 

Report the results along the following criteria: 
1. Error rate on an independent testing set
2. Computational costs expressed as the number of example presentations needed to achieve 100% accuracy.
